# Gene Fusion classification(TBD)

A machine learning pipeline extracting "Gene fusion" in text corpus.

## Getting Started

Introduction ... 

### Prerequisites

Run :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Needs datasets in `data` folder
- Needs word embeddings in `word_embeddings` folder

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
